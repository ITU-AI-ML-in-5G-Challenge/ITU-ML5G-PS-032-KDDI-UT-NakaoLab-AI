# Program Directory Structure Description
- conf.yaml: All path configurations
- 1_json_extract.py: Extract all the json files into csv files and store them on a daily basis.
- 2_csv_combine.py: Merge all the CSV into training and test sets.
- 3_csv_generate.py: Differentiate the data in the dataset by line to generate a new diff_dataset.
- 4_train_diff.py: Train and test diff_dataset and print test results.
- label_extract.py: Class of Extracting labels
- diff_analysis.ipynb: Train and test diff_dataset(for jupyter notebook).
- feature_importance_analysis.ipynb: Feature Importance Analysis(for jupyter notebook).
