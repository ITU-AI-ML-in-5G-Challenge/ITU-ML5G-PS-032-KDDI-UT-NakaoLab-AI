# Program Directory Structure Description
- `conf.yaml`: All path configurations
- `1_json_extract.py`: Extract all the json files into csv files and store them on a daily basis.
- `2_csv_combine.py`: Merge all the CSV into training and test sets.
- `3_csv_generate.py`: Differentiate the data in the dataset by line to generate a new diff_dataset.
- `4_train_diff.py`: Train and test diff_dataset and print test results.
- `label_extract.py`: Class of Extracting labels
- `diff_analysis.ipynb`: Train and test diff_dataset(for jupyter notebook).
- `feature_importance_analysis.ipynb`: Feature Importance Analysis(for jupyter notebook).

# Path Configuration Property Description
- Config of `1_json_extract.py`
    - `DATA_SET`: The root directory of the dataset, you need to put the label json file under this.
    - `LEARNING_DIR`: The data set for learning of Theme 1. Default path is "DATA_SET/data-for-learning".
    - `EVALUATION_DIR`: The data set for evaluation of Theme 1. Default path is "DATA_SET/data-for-evaluation".
    - `PHYSICAL_SUB_DIR`: Physical subdirectory.
    - `NETWORK_SUB_DIR`: Network subdirectory.
    - `VIRTUAL_SUB_DIR`: Virtual subdirectory.

- Config of `2_csv_combine.py`, `3_csv_diff_generate.py`, `4_train_diff.py`
    - `TRAIN_PATH`: The learning CSV file generated from 1_json_extract. Default path is "DATA_SET/csv-for-learning/".
    - `TEST_PATH`: The evaluation CSV file generated from 1_json_extract. Default path is "DATA_SET/csv-for-evaluation/".
    - `CSV_DATA_SET`: The CSV file generated by "2_csv_combine". Default file path is "./csv/dataset.csv".
    - `CSV_TEST_SET`: The CSV file generated by "2_csv_combine". Default file path is "./csv/testset.csv".
    - `CSV_DIFF_DATA_SET`: The CSV file generated by "3_csv_diff_generate". Default file path is "./csv/diff_dataset.csv".
    - `CSV_DIFF_TEST_SET`: The CSV file generated by "3_csv_diff_generate". Default file path is "./csv/diff_testset.csv".

# Program Running Environment
- [Python 3.7.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-376/)
- [jupyter-notebook 6.0.3](https://jupyter.org/install)

# Getting Started
Check the Python versionï¼š

        python -V
        
Switch to project directory:

        cd <Your path>/itu-ml-challenge
        
If you have not completed the extraction steps:
Modify the path information in the configuration file.
Make sure `<TRAIN_PATH>, <TEST_PATH> (conf.yaml) these two folders exist.
Then run (Attention: this step takes about 10+ hours to extract all the JSON files!):
        
        python ./1_json_extract.py
            
Check that a CSV file has been generated under <TRAIN_PATH> and <TEST_PATH>.
Then run:

        python ./2_csv_combine.py

Check whether `dataset.csv` and `testset.csv` have been generated under `./csv/` in the current directory.
Then run:
        
        python ./3_csv_diff_generate.py
        
Check whether `diff_dataset.csv` and `diff_testset.csv` have been generated under `./csv/` in the current directory.        
If these two files have been generated, congratulations on the completion of the extraction.
Then run:

        python ./4_train_diff.py
        
You will see the training and test results printed on the console.
At the same time, you can also use jupyter notebook to analyze the data.

        jupyter notebook
        
Choose to open `diff_analysis.ipynb` and `feature_importance_analysis.ipynb`.
